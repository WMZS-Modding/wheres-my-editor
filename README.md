# Where's My Editor
 A level editor for Where's My Water (android)
 
 NOTE: If you came here to read a .waltex image, then go to [wmwpy](https://github.com/wmw-modding/wmwpy/blob/main/src/wmwpy/Utils/Waltex.py), because I will be removing Waltex.py from wme.

# Setup

run
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
or
```
py -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Start by extracting your where's my water apk file into a directory. When you run the program for the first timze, it'll ask you to select the game directory. This can also be configurable in the `settings.json` file that is generated by the program.

# Todo

- [x] Export `xml` file
- [ ] Export `png` file
- [x] Add and remove objects
- [ ] Room object
- [ ] Image editor
- [ ] Complete settings menu
- [ ] Level explorer
- [ ] Fix some objects not loading

# Credits
- Thanks to [campbellsonic](https://github.com/campbellsonic) for the script to load `waltex` images. I could not have done it without them.
